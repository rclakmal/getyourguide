## What metric did you choose? What was the reason for choosing it?

    SEM  = Mean Impression * Mean CRT * Mean Position * (Mean Revenue/Mean Cost)

## Results evaluation and discussion

As you can see from the results.csv, GYG performs well in CTR, but fails to perform in positioning of ranking and impressions. GYG also has a good revenue, but also on a high cost. So the revenue/cost ratio is not that great. 

Overall GYG ranks 5th position. 

## What are the recommendations you would give us to improve our paid marketing strategy based on your results?  

GYG should focus on metrics they lack behind. For an example with better keywords and better content it could improve positioning. Looking out for alternative and cheaper advertisement methods will reduce the cost and increase revenue/cost ratio. 

## What are the pros and cons of your approach?

It takes all the metrics into consideration without any biases. It is good to get an overall picture. However, in reality, some of these metrics might be more important than others. Such as high revenue. We need to identify proper weighting system to get these invidiual importance into consideration.

## How would you improve your solution if you had a few more hours to work on the problem?

As mentioned above, I would try to learn a proper weighting system based on other online research and available training data set.
